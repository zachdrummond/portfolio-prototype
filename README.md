# My Responsive Portfolio

## Description
This is a prototype of my responsive portfolio. I designed this website in such a way that it would render well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. I hope to be able to use this website one day to showcase all of my web applications

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

## Updates
The website needed to be updated in order to meet accessibility standards, to be optimized for search engines, to improve functionality, and to be easier for developers to understand. These updates were made to the application:
* I added a concise, descriptive title.
* I improved the readability of the code.
* I structured the HTML elements and CSS selectors to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* I combined several CSS selectors.
* I changed the non-semantic HTML elements to semantic HTML elements.
* I organized the HTML heading attributes to follow a sequential order.
* I moved the hero image from the CSS file to the HTML file in order to give it an accessible alt attribute.
* I added accessible alt attributes to all of the image elements.
* I improved the functionality of the navigation bar.
* I added comments to the HTML and CSS files.
